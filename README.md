## Logistical
- What hours will you be available to communicate?: 9a-6p, open to responses past 6p if there’s an emergency
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?: Slack
- How often will you take breaks?: If we need to take a 10min break, we can communicate to each other. Otherwise, 30min dinner break
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?: Work later in the night, maybe until 10pm

## Cooperative
- Make a list of each person’s strengths:
  - Jake
    - Can follow demo code
    - Comfortable googling things
    - General understanding of all of it
    - Good at support, figuring out what we need to do as a group
    - Great emotional support
    - Great at asking questions
  - Simone
    - Can follow demo code
    - Stronger in CSS
    - Okay to break things
    - Organized
    - Good at keeping it light, positive attitude
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?: Whoever feels the least comfortable with the topic will be driving so that they can learn from the navigator.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?:
  - Jake
    - React
    - Reading/understanding code
    - Being able to come up with my own ideas and not have to rely so heavily on demo code
    - Improve workflow
  - Simone
    - React
    - Being able to come up with my own ideas and not have to rely so heavily on demo code
    - Debugging
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?: Whoever feels the least comfortable with the topic will be driving so that they can learn from the navigator. We’ll make sure to check in with each other and recap our code

## Conflict Resolution
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?: We set up our workflow so that hopefully this doesn’t happen. We’ll make sure our partner understands what’s going on by doing check ins if they get quiet.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?: We will agree to communicate if we don’t feel like we’re contributing.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?: Keep checking in with your partner and keep recapping our code so that we both know what is going on.
